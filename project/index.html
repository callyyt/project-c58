<p>'Pedro and Alma Madrigal, a young married couple, are forced to flee their home village in Colombia with their infant triplets due to an armed conflict. Alma watches as her husband, Pedro is killed but stares at her infant triplets: Julieta, Pepa, and Bruno. Alma's candle miraculously attains magical qualities, blasting away the perpetrators and creating a sentient house (the "Casita") for the family within an encanto, a magical realm ringed by high mountains. Fifty years later, the still-burning candle protects a nearby thriving town, and its magic grants "gifts" to each Madrigal descendant at the age of five, which they use to serve the villagers. However, Bruno, vilified and scapegoated for his gift of precognition, disappeared ten years earlier, while Julieta's youngest daughter, 15-year-old Mirabel, has never been granted a gift of her own.</p>

<p>HOLY! WOW! WHAT AN ADVENTURE! I loved how the story focused on bringing others together then blowing things up. I loved how the story was set in Autumn. Autumn is the season that most people aren’t interested in. When people watch this movie people will realize that Autumn is festive if we just see it from a different perspective. I also loved how the native people who lived in the forest rely upon and trust nature. That is the way we are supposed to view nature.</p>

  In a small Buckinghamshire village forty minutes by bus away from Reading and 8 miles from the Bingo club in Aylesbury, Matilda Wormwood is born to Mr and Mrs Wormwood. She immediately shows amazing precocity, learning to speak at age one and to read at age three and a half, perusing all the children's books in the library by the age of four and three months and moving on to longer classics such as Great Expectations and Jane Eyre. However, her parents (particularly her father) ignore and emotionally abuse her and completely refuse to acknowledge her abilities, and Matilda finds herself forced to pull pranks on them (such as gluing her father's hat to his head, sticking a parrot in the chimney to simulate a burglar or ghost, and bleaching her father's hair) to avoid getting frustrated.</p>

  Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.[2][3][4] A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night.[5] Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries,[6][7][8] is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians,[9] as well as culturally by many non-Christians,[1][10] and forms an integral part of the holiday season organized around it.</p>
